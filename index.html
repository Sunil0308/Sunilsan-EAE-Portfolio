                    I am a Secondary 4 student studying at Bukit View Secondary School. My hobbies are reading manga, playing volleyball with my friends and watching anime. 
                    I was a Student Councilor and CCA Exco (NCC Land) before I stepped down earlier this year. I wanted to do this project so that I could prove to myself that I love coding and I wouldn't find it tiring even if faced with hurdles.
                    After doing this project, I realized that I find coding very exciting, frustrating at times, and educational. It's a simple website, nothing fancy, but it means a lot as it took me days and countless youtube
                    videos to help me code this website.

                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to join this course as although I didn't take computing as a subject, I wanted to learn coding and the how AI works. As learning code from youtube can only get you so far, I would like to join the course to answer my questions of major concepts like adding functions to code, or making a responsive page that works as you interact with the website or page. Also, I have always 
                    had the lifelong goal of coding something that is as special as ChatGPT which has now become a part of our everyday lives. Although I may not be able to replicate the idea of a successful interactive model like chatgpt, I aspire to do something along those lines. Essentially, I want to code something 
                    that will be complex enough for me to take pride in knowing that it was something I did while also helping to give back to society which has helped me broaden my horizons.

                <p>This was me when I finished my Basic Freestyles Drill Instructor Course in Sec 3. Before the first day, I thought that having to wake up at 5 am just to travel 1 whole hour on the MRT alone would be my biggest challenge. Boy was I wrong. It was just the tip of the iceberg to the amount of energy draining activities I would be forced to overcome. Nevertheless, I persevered and managed to finish my course and became a drills instructor.</p>

                <p>This picture was after my floorball inter-class competition in Sec 3. Although I wasn't the best in floorball, I chose to overcome my boundaries and sign up for the team. I was then put to the test as I had to join in the games as soon as possible, me being a volleyball or basketball type of person, just couldn't bring myself to play with a ball so small and controlling it with a stick nevertheless. But anyhow, we managed to get 1st in our cohort.</p>

                <p>This picture is especially special to me as this was taken on the day I stepped down from NCC. At first, I thought that I would be happy to step down as the days of trying to change from school uniform to NCC uniform in under 10 minutes would finally end, no more nagging to polish my boots, no more roll call meetings. But after stepping down, I started to miss such imperfections in my life. This was because those times I didn't have to worry about the upcoming O-levels as they then seemed as though they were miles away.</p>
